 Juan's Car Dealership Platform is a web-based project that simulates a real car dealership. Users can browse available cars, learn about services, and contact the dealership through the website. It includes several pages, each with its own purpose, and uses PHP to handle form submissions.

The platform is organized into different PHP files, each serving a unique function, and a CSS file for styling. The index.php is the homepage, welcoming visitors and showcasing featured cars. The inventory.php lists cars for sale with filtering options to help users find what they need. The services.php describes the dealership's offerings, while the contact.php page includes a form for users to send inquiries, which are processed by processorder.php and confirmed with a message.

I built this platform using concepts from Chapters 1-7 of my coursework. I used basic HTML for the layout in index.php, created filtering forms in inventory.php, and based the contact form and processing script on the PHP lessons from Chapter 3. I added error checking in processorder.php and used styles.css to keep the design consistent.
During development, I faced a few challenges. I wanted the contact form to be easy to use, so I adjusted the layout and added placeholder text to guide users. I also spent time improving the design of the inventory page with CSS. 

 Overall, building this platform was a great learning experience. I applied what I learned in class and overcame the challenges to create a working car dealership website that I can continue to improve.
